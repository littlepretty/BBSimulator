\section{Simulation Results}
We consider the full Trinity platform super computer.
Number of compute nodes is about 18936, 9436(Intel Haswell) and 9500(Intel Xeon Phi) nodes.
It has 576 burst buffer nodes each with 3.3 TB/s bandwidth, total capacity 3.7 PB.
Lustre Parallel File System support 39 PB storage capacity with 7.5 GB/s sustained bandwidth.

Simulation setting:
40960 compute nodes, 163840 cores.
Bandwidth between Burst buffer nodes and compute nodes is 3.3 TB/s
Bandwidth between CPU and IO nodes is 7.5 GB/s.

We use discrete event simulation to address the following questions.
Will Cerberus improve application performance by utilizing burst buffer nodes?
Can Cerberus with optimization improve application performance?
Will job demand on burst buffer effect Cerberus?
