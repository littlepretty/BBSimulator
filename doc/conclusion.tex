\section{Conclusion and Future Works}
\label{Sec:Conclusion}

In this study we explore the way HPC workload scheduler allocates burst buffer,
a new storage resources that absorb 3 general types of IO operations:
file staging in, application checkpointing, and file staging out.
We propose a 3-phase job model specially
tailored to burst buffer's typical usage scenarios.
Cerberus is presented on the basis of such model.
We divide the scheduling problem into 3 phases
and conquer them separately using dynamic programming based optimization.
Simulation results show that
Cerberus could improve application's perceived IO bandwidth significantly.
There are a lot of future works to be done for Cerberus.
Implementing Cerberus on realistic environment, for example,
Trinity supercomputing system, should be beneficial to a variety of
scientific applications.
