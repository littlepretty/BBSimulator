\section{Cerberus and Optimization Enhancement}
\label{Sec:Scheduler}

\subsection{Cerberus for 3-Phase Jobs}
Traditional batch scheduler usually looks at the field of $c_i$ and $rt_i$
when making scheduling decision.
One straightforward way to make decisions on non-burst-buffer HPC system is
First Come First Serve, as long as available compute nodes can satisfy user job.
Once the system is equipped with burst buffer, scheduler must consider a new constraint:
the available amount of burst buffer capacity.
Scheduling is divided into 3 phases to
adopt to the 3-phase characteristic of jobs in burst buffer context.
As shown in Figure~\ref{Fig:CerberusQueues},
Cerberus schedules jobs in 3 distinct set/queue.
The input queue $Q_I$ contains all the jobs that
needs to load input data before they are able to execute.
Once a job comes out of input queue, its data flows from external disk
to burst buffer nodes, indicated by the red arrow.
Compute nodes are not allocated to the application until
data flows from burst buffer to memory on compute nodes.
The run queue $Q_R$ contains all the jobs waiting to be run with loaded data.
Before executing, input data must be transfered to memory on compute nodes,
after which burst buffer used for stage-in can be released.
When running application request checkpointing, its execution and data are
pushed to its exclusive burst buffer nodes;
when application resume from system fault, its checkpointing are
loaded directly from burst buffer, instead of PFS, to compute nodes.
The output queue $Q_O$ contains all the jobs that
terminate execution but needs to write output data to external storage.
As soon as output data is moved from memory to burst buffer nodes allocated for stage-out,
compute nodes can be released;
in other words, other applications ready to run can take up them now.
At anytime, a job can only appear in one of the 3 sets, apparently.
This fact motivates separated scheduling idiom to be used in different phases,
or for different job queues.

\subsection{Optimize Stage-In Phase}
In the stage-in phase, only burst buffer demand is considered.
Scheduling is made based on the value of $bb\_in$ of jobs in $Q_I$.
If we care about data transfer throughput,
we should transfer as much data as possible by doing the following optimization:
\begin{align*}
        & \max \sum_{i\in S} bb\_in_i \\
        & s.t. \sum_{i\in S} bb\_in_i \leq BB_{available} \numberthis \label{Equ:MaxTransferData}
        %\left\{
                %\begin{array}{l}
                        %S \subseteq J_{Q_I} \\ [1em]
                        %\sum_{i\in S} bb\_in_i \leq BB_{available}
                %\end{array} 
        %\right.
\end{align*}
where $J_{Q_I}$ stands for all jobs in input queue at the time considering,
$S\subseteq J_{Q_I}$ is the set of job selected by Cerberus,
$bb\_in_i$ is the burst buffer demand of $job_i$,
$BB_{available}$ is system's available amount of burst buffer.

If we care about task parallelism, following optimization could help:
\begin{align*}
        & \max |S| \\
        & s.t. \sum_{i\in S} bb\_in_i \leq BB_{available} \numberthis \label{Equ:MaxTaskNumber}  
        %\left\{
                %\begin{array}{l}
                        %S \subseteq J_{Q_I} \\ [1em] 
                        %\sum_{i\in S} bb\_in_i \leq BB_{available}
                %\end{array} 
        %\right.
\end{align*}
The number of tasks doing data loading will be maximized.


\subsection{Optimize Running Phase}
Running jobs require not only compute nodes, but burst buffer to ensure performance and correctness.
Scheduling are accordingly made based on the value of $c$ and $bb\_run$ of jobs in $Q_R$.
To maximize multiple types of resource's utilization,
we convert it to the knapsack problem by defining the value of the $job_i$ as
\begin{equation}
        v_i = \frac{c_i / CN}{rt_i} \times \frac{bb\_run_i / BB}{rt_i}
        \label{Equ:DefValue}
\end{equation}
where $rt_i$ is the running time of $job_i$, the time it takes up the computing nodes.
By defining \textit{value} as Equation~\ref{Equ:DefValue},
we prefer these tasks that claims to take up node resources with short duration.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict $rt_i$ before actually running the job.
Of course we could use the \textit{expected running time} $ert_i$ specified by user.
However, by examining the log traces from Argonne National Laboratory (ANL)\cite{JobTrace},
we found that the variance between $rt_i$ and $ert_i$ is significantly different.
For now we can just assume $ert_i$ represent $rt_i$ of $job_i$.
In the future, we could adopt machine learning or data mining ideas
to predict the running time of a job with demand vector.
%Notice that then the value of a task is proportional to $c_i*bb_i$.
The optimizing formula can thus be
\begin{align*}
        & \max \sum_{i \in S}\frac{c_i}{ert_i} * \frac{bb\_run_i}{ert_i} \\
        & s.t. \left\{
                \begin{array}{l}
                        %S \subseteq J_{Q_R} \\ [1em]
                        \sum_{i \in S} c_i \leq CN_{available} \\ [0.5em]\numberthis \label{Equ:MaxProduct} 
                        \sum_{i \in S} bb\_run_i \leq BB_{available}
                \end{array} 
        \right.
\end{align*}
where $J_{Q_R}$ is the set of jobs in running queue,
$S\subseteq J_{Q_R}$ stands for jobs selected by scheduler,
$CN_{available}$ and $BB_{available}$ represent the amount of system's available resources
(compute nodes and burst buffer nodes) at current moment.

\subsection{Optimize Stage-Out Phase}
Scheduling are made based on the value of $bb\_out$ of jobs in $Q_O$.
Optimization formula for different purpose are almost the same as
Equation~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferData} and Equation~\ref{Equ:MaxTaskNumber}
in stage-in scheduling, except that $bb\_in$ is replaced with $bb\_out$,
$J_{Q_I}$ is replaced with $J_{Q_O}$, the job set of output queue.


\subsection{Solving the Optimization Problems}
It is trivial to show that optimization problem~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferData}
and~\ref{Equ:MaxTaskNumber}
are equivalent to 0-1 knapsack problem.
Problem~\ref{Equ:MaxProduct} can be informally treat as 2-dimension 0-1 knapsack problem.
In fact, we expect all of them are NP-hard problems.
We can solve them with dynamic programming in pseudo polynomial time.
Applying memorization could also help accelerate the solving process.
In fact we are not interested in the optimal result of problem~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferData},
problem~\ref{Equ:MaxTaskNumber} and problem~\ref{Equ:MaxProduct} at all
but in a combination of jobs that yields the optimal solution,
which can also be easily tracked back down by keeping memorizations.

%The solution to Problem~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferData},
%Problem~\ref{Equ:MaxTaskNumber} and Problem~\ref{Equ:MaxProduct} are similar.
First, for Problem~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferData}, the recursive relationship is
given by Recursion~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferDataRecursion}.
In~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferDataRecursion}, the memo we keeps during solving is
the optimal solution for 
$jobs=(job_1, job_2, \ldots, job_i)$ with $w$ GB of available burst buffer.
It turns out that the recursion for Problem~\ref{Equ:MaxTaskNumber} is
extremely similar to~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferDataRecursion}
The memo in Recursion~\ref{Equ:MaxTaskNumberRecursion} is the same
as that in Recursion~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferDataRecursion}.
The recursion for Problem~\ref{Equ:MaxProduct} is a little bit complicated.
Here we should keep the memo of the optimal solution for $jobs=(job_1, job_2, \ldots, job_i)$
with $c$ computing nodes and $w$ GB of burst buffer being available.

Scheduler can obtain an optimal combination of jobs by examining the memo.
Take the problem~\ref{Equ:MaxProduct} problem for example.
We start from $dp(n, CN, BB)$.
If $c_n \leq CN$ and $bb\_in_n \leq BB$, $job_n$ should be scheduled if
$dp(i-1, c, w) \leq dp(i-1, c - c_i, w - bb\_in_i) + c_i bb\_in_i$ and
recurse with $dp(n - 1, CN - c_i, BB - bb\_in_i)$;
otherwise, $job_n$ should be skipped and we recurse the process on $dp(n-1, CN, BB)$.
The time complexity of solving Equation~\ref{Equ:MaxTransferDataRecursion} and
Equation~\ref{Equ:MaxTaskNumberRecursion} is $O(n\times BB)$.
The time complexity of solving Recursion~\ref{Equ:MaxProductRecursion}
is $O(n\times CN\times BB)$.
Notice that $CN$ and $BB$ may be very large integers,
making the pseudo-polynomial algorithm unsuitable
to be used online by scheduler.
In practice, we could reduce the time complexity by allocating resource
in a coarser granularity.
For example, jobs usually asks for compute node in the unit of $cn\_unit = 512$ nodes;
their demands for burst buffer nodes are usually in the unit of $bb\_unit = 100$ GB.
We can divide both $CN$ and $c_i$ by $cn\_unit$;
divide both $BB$ and $bb\_in, bb\_run, bb\_out$ by $bb\_unit$.
It is also possible to reduce the value of $n$, the number of jobs in the queue.
For example, we can consider only $\frac{1}{\alpha}n$ jobs in the queue.
This will give us only the partial optimal solution
in exchange of less computation complexity.
